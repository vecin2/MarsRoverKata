Mars Rover

Develop an api that moves a rover around on a grid.
Rules:

    You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover and the direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.
    The rover receives a character array of commands.
    Implement commands that move the rover forward/backward (f,b).
    Implement commands that turn the rover left/right (l,r).
    Implement wrapping from one edge of the grid to another. (planets are spheres after all)
    Implement obstacle detection before each move to a new square. If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last possible point and reports the obstacle.
    
    
    Here is an example:
- Let's say that the rover is located at 0,0 facing North on a 100x100 grid.
- Given the command "ffrff" would put the rover at 2,2 facing East. 


------ tests--------
given an initial position robot returns that position when asked
turn left and right
move forward and backward
combine movements
Implement wrapping from one edge of the grid to another

-----todo--------
refactor instance variable to static variable -cardinal_directions
private :assert_movement
